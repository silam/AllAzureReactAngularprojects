**Hands-On full stack web development using ASP.NET Core, React, and TypeScript 3**

## What is this book about?
Microsoft's ASP.NET Core is a robust and high-performing cross-platform web API framework, and Facebook's React uses declarative JavaScript to drive a rich, interactive user experience on the client-side web. Together, they can be used to build full stack apps with enhanced security and scalability at each layer.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Build RESTful APIs with .NET Core using API controllers
* Create strongly typed, interactive, and function-based React components using Hooks
* Build forms efficiently using reusable React components
* Perform client-side state management with Redux and the React Context API
* Secure REST APIs with ASP.NET identity and authorization policies
